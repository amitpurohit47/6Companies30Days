[![Problem Link](https://img.shields.io/badge/GeeksforGeeks-298D46?style=for-the-badge&logo=geeksforgeeks&logoColor=white)](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/overlapping-rectangles1924/1/)

Given two rectangles, find if the given two rectangles overlap or not. A rectangle is denoted by providing the x and y coordinates of two points: the left top corner and the right bottom corner of the rectangle. Two rectangles sharing a side are considered overlapping. (L1 and R1 are the extreme points of the first rectangle and L2 and R2 are the extreme points of the second rectangle).

**Note:** It may be assumed that the rectangles are parallel to the coordinate axis.
