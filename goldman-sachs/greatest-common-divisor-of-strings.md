For two strings s and t, we say "t divides s" if and only if s = t + ... + t (i.e., t is concatenated with itself one or more times).

Given two strings str1 and str2, return the largest string x such that x divides both str1 and str2.

### Example 1
```
Input: str1 = "ABCABC", str2 = "ABC"
Output: "ABC"
```
### Example 2
```
Input: str1 = "LEET", str2 = "CODE"
Output: ""
```

### Solution
```cpp

```

### Accepted
