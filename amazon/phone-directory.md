Given a list of contacts contact[] of length n where each contact is a string which exist in a phone directory and a query string s. The task is to implement a search query for the phone directory. Run a search query for each prefix p of the query string s (i.e. from  index 1 to |s|) that prints all the distinct contacts which have the same prefix as p in lexicographical increasing order. Please refer the explanation part for better understanding.

**Note:** If there is no match between query and contacts, print "0".
