# As Far from Land as Possible

[![Problem Link](../assets/lc.svg)](https://leetcode.com/problems/as-far-from-land-as-possible/)

Given an n x n grid containing only values 0 and 1, where 0 represents water and 1 represents land, find a water cell such that its distance to the nearest land cell is maximized, and return the distance. If no land or water exists in the grid, return -1.

The distance used in this problem is the Manhattan distance: the distance between two cells (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) is |x0 - x1| + |y0 - y1|.

### Example 1
```
Input: grid = [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]
Output: 2
```

### Example 2
```
Input: grid = [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 4
```

### Solution
```cpp

```

### Accepted
